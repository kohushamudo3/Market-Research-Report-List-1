<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval systems are essential tools in medical procedures used to collect samples safely during surgeries. The market is divided into two main types: detachable and non-detachable systems. Detachable systems allow for the separation of the specimen from the retrieval device, facilitating easier handling and transport of the sample. In contrast, non-detachable systems keep the specimen attached to the device, which can be useful for certain surgical techniques where avoidance of specimen contamination is critical. Both types play crucial roles in different surgical settings.</p></p>
